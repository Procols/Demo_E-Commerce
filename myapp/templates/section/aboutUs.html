                        Founded on 24th August 2023,First Indiaculture began its journey in Kuruppanaickenpalayam, Mettur Main road, Bhavani-Erode, and moved on Chithode, Erode, with a simple yet powerful mission: to provide affordable, high-quality, natural beauty products that promote healthy living and holistic self-care. Our flagship product, Natural Hair Oil, marked the beginning of our offline sales journey, supported by proper documentation, including MSME and FSSAI registrations.

                    <p>
                        For one year, we focused exclusively on offline retail, building trust with our customers through genuine products and personalized service. In our second year, we embraced the power of digital, launching our online store and consistently sharing educational and engaging videos. Our content quickly gained attention, allowing us to connect with a wider audience and expand our product range.
